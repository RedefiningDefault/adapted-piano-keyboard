This piano keyboard was adapted by Kirsten Moreau of [Redefining Default LLC](www.redefining-default.com).

The original piano keyboard code came from Joe Liang of [1000 Mile World](http://1000mileworld.com/Portfolio/Piano/keyboard.html), who in turn based his code on a dynamically generated synthetic keyboard made by [Keith William Horwood](https://keithwhor.com/music/).
